           - Unfortunately, Microsoft has added a clever new
           - "feature" to Internet Explorer. If the text of
           - an error's message is "too small", specifically
           - less than 512 bytes, Internet Explorer returns
           - its own error message. You can turn that off,
           - but it's pretty tricky to find switch called
           - "smart error messages". That means, of course,
           - that short error messages are censored by default.
           - IIS always returns error messages that are long
           - enough to make Internet Explorer happy. The
           - workaround is pretty simple: pad the error
           - message with a big comment like this to push it
           - over the five hundred and twelve bytes minimum.
           - Of course, that's exactly what you're reading
           - right now.
